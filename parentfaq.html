	<p> Why should my son join a fraternity?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><br />
      There are many benefits to joining a  fraternity received both during undergraduate years as well as post graduation.  Below are just a few of said benefits.<br />
      Academics - 
      Your son will be making the transition  to college from an obviously different atmosphere. While adjustment may be  harder on some than others, having the resource of a fraternity full of  brothers who have not only taken the same classes, but have experience in the  college environment to depend on, can greatly reduce the difficulty of that  transition. We have brothers in all areas of study from business to multiple  engineering fields and teaching to pre-pharmacy.<br />
      Lifelong Friends - 
      Your son will be making plenty of new  friends at college, but few will be lifelong friends as those gained a  fraternity. From vacationing with brothers on spring break to having a network  on which to rely for jobs, interviews, and contacts, our fraternity is a  lifelong resource that can be found all over the country and even some other  countries.<br />
      Leadership -
      Our fraternity alone has about 30 leadership  positions. Those are 30 leadership positions that can not only help your son  develop character, but those are 30 leadership positions which look great on résumés. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>What is the time commitment my son can  expect from your fraternity?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><br />
      When it comes to a fraternity, the  amount of time you put in will rely solely on how much time the member wishes  to put in. A general member can be expected to put in about 3 to 4 hours a  week, while a chairperson and executive member can expect to put in an hour to  3 hours more per week. This time is spent in chapter meetings, committee  meetings, and general workshops. However, if the member wishes, additional time  will be spent at brotherhood events, intramural sports, as well as social  events.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>What is the cost my son/I can expect to  pay?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><br />
      Sigma Pi retains some of the lowest  costs of any fraternity nationally. The Greek Experience is an investment in your student's  future. The leadership skills, the academic assistance, and friendships will  benefit your child beyond their college days. The perception that fraternities  are only an option for “rich” students is widespread and false. Greek  organizations are quite affordable and fees go to services that will positively  impact your son. Many students work to supplement funding for their dues.  Member’s dues directly support the betterment of the chapter and the national  organization. To assist members, chapters may offer various scholarships and  grants. We encourage your son to ask questions related to finances during the  recruitment process. We also encourage you to be ”hands-on” in this decision if  you have any questions about the obligations regarding finances.&nbsp;Initially,  there is a pledge fee of $150, there is then an initiation fee of $350. Once  initiated, brothers pay dues once semesterly which vary depending on whether or  not they live in our chapter house. It can be expected that dues will range  from $360 to $500 per semester.</p>

<p>Is  there an alcohol policy? </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <br />
      Each chapter has an alcohol policy in which there are yearly educational  programs that the chapter is required to present to its members. The  international philanthropy of Sigma Pi is the Sam Spady Foundation (<a href="http://www.samspadyfoundation.org/" target="_blank">www.samspadyfoundation.org</a>)  whose mission is to educate all parents and students on the dangers of alcohol,  specifically high-risk consumption, and the signs and symptoms of alcohol  poisoning.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;<br />
  What about hazing?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <br />
      Sigma Pi strictly prohibits all forms of hazing. A holistic definition of  hazing can also be found in every University’s Code of Polices and Regulations  Applying to All Students. The Fraternity investigates all allegations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><br />
  What is my role as a parent?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <br />
      Take the time to find out more about the chapter your son is joining. Ask  questions about what the organizations will offer your child and allow them to  make the best decision for themselves. Once your child chooses to join a chapter,  there will be opportunities for Mom’s and Dad’s weekend activities, as well as  football games, or a number of other activities.<br />
      As you look into the Greek Community with your son consider the following  information compiled by national studies:&nbsp;<br />
      Fraternity affiliation can positively influence retention through graduation.  Fraternity affiliation directly impacts campus involvement and overall student  satisfaction with college. Fraternity affiliation can positively influence  involvement in civic organizations after college. Some statistics compiled by  the North-American Interfraternity Conference include:</p>

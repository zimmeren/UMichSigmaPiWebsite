	Why join Sigma Pi Alpha Beta chapter? 
	<ul> <li> The chance to be a part of something bigger. Sigma Pi is currently one of the newer and smaller fraternities on campus and 
	has been experiencing steady growth since its creation.  In joining you will actively be involved in this fraternity's future. </li> <br />
	<li> The opportunity for leadership roles. As a small chapter, leadership roles are abundant and the experience gained
	 is unparalleled. </li> <br />
	<li> Strong brotherhood. As a small fraternity every brother gets the opportunity to know every brother very well and develop
	lifelong connections. </li> <br />
	<li> One of the best houses on campus. Don't believe us? Stop by and check it out. </li> <br />
	<li> Cheap rent and dues. Sigma Pi is known nationally as having some of the most affordable dues and to live in one of the 22 rooms in our
	chapter house is less than $600 a month for your own room. A nice break from those normal Ann Arbor rates. </li> <br />
	<li> Connections. With over 100,000 alumni and undergraduate members nationally, the connections gained by joining 
	Sigma Pi will make finding the right job just that much easier. </li> <br />  
	</ul>
